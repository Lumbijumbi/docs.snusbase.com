# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: June 12th, 2023. Last Updated: December 25th, 2025.

Welcome. This Privacy Policy explains how we, Snusbase.com (also referred to as "we", "us", or "our"), collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our Data Breach Search Engine and related services (collectively referred to as the "Services").

## 1. Collection of Personal Information

We collect the following personal information when you use our Services: your email address, username, and account creation time.

During your use of our Services, we may temporarily log limited technical metadata related to searches, including:

* The time a search was made
* The user account that initiated the search
* The number of results returned
* The duration of the search request
* The search configuration options selected, such as wildcard usage, search type, or similar non-content parameters

We do not log, store, record, or retain the actual search terms, query inputs, identifiers searched for, or the content of any search. Search terms and query contents are processed in memory only and remain private to the user.

All search-related metadata logs are retained for a period of exactly five (5) minutes and are then permanently deleted.

## 2. Use of Personal Information

We use your personal information to provide and improve our Services, respond to inquiries, manage user accounts, and ensure compliance with our Terms of Service.

The temporary collection of search-related metadata, including selected search options, is used solely for operational purposes such as maintaining service stability, diagnosing errors, preventing abuse, and optimizing performance. This information is not used for profiling, behavioral analysis, or monitoring the substance of user searches.

## 3. No Sharing of Personal Information

We do not sell, rent, distribute, or share your personal information or search-related metadata with any third parties or service providers under any circumstances.

All personal information is used strictly for the operation and maintenance of our Services.

## 4. Protection of Personal Information

We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. While we take security seriously, no system can be guaranteed to be completely secure.

## 5. Retention of Personal Information

Account-related personal information is retained only for as long as necessary to provide the Services or comply with applicable legal obligations.

Search metadata, as described in Section 1, is automatically deleted after five (5) minutes. Search terms and query contents are never retained.

## 6. Warrant Canary

As long as this section is present in our Privacy Policy, we affirm that we have not received any secret requests for user information from government entities, have not been subject to any gag orders, and have not been served with any secret court orders.

## 7. Your Rights

Subject to applicable laws, you have the right to access, correct, delete, or restrict the processing of your personal information. To exercise these rights, please contact us through our designated contact channels.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to modify or update this Privacy Policy at any time. Continued use of the Services following any changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
